# EU_Sustainability_Tracker
This project automatically monitors the European Parliament and Commission’s daily legislative debates and committee discussions to identify documents directly related to environmental and climate sustainability, circular economy, resource conservation, and pollution reduction. It performs the following steps:

Fetch the day’s debate agenda from the EU’s OEIL portal.

Parse each procedure’s reference number, committee, rapporteur, title, description, and PDF link.

Classify relevance to sustainability using Google’s Gemini LLM.

Persist all sustainability-related items into a Google Sheet for easy reporting.

Create follow-up review tasks in Google Tasks so industry teams can stay up to date.

By automating this workflow, enterprises in regulated sectors gain a continuous, up-to-date feed of the latest EU policy initiatives on sustainability—helping them react faster, maintain compliance, and plan strategic responses.
